#2. PS/2 Murder:
Problem: Once system powered on sometimes if you use PS/2 keyboard/mouse it can disable one or both of the PS/2 devices or cause a kernel panic.
The cause: Allowing user input during initializing.

#3. The Box Boogie:
Problem: After adding cursor for some weird reson their is a weird black box in the top left corner.
The cause: Calling clear cursor before calling draw cursor their for the list was never saved and it defualts to 0 and it draws 0.
Fix: Adding cursor initialized then set it to true and return if its false and continue if its true.
